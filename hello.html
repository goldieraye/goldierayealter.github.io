			<h2>Can I tell you a secret?<br/>I have to whisper it to you...</h2>
			
			<p> You know that feeling you get when you close your eyes? Go ahead, close them. Just listen to the sound of my voice and think of that dark, moist place resting behind your eyelids. Sit there for a moment. In silence. Now imagine the veins there, the blood that courses through every fiber of you. Quiet your mind and you can hear it flowing over you, through you, inside of you. It's warm isn't it? Maybe even a little hot? You can feel it starting in your finger tips and in the very ends of your toes, whatever they are touching there is hot and fluid and real. It starts to feel a little too real, a little bit sinister even because you don't know if you're really touching it. Try to feel it. Imagine it. The heat pulsing through the bottoms of your feet, and slowly, very slowly up through your legs and down your fingertips into your arms. You can feel it flowing up toward the center of you, long and slow and hot and black... it's there. And it's reaching further now inside of you, in your lungs, breathing up and down there flowing closer now to your stomach where it swirls there like the blood that flows through your dark eyelids. Hot and heavy. Pulsing through you. You can feel it going even deeper now, deep, deep inside of you in your guts and between your legs. Feel your legs, how they're pulsing, throbbing now, the blood there entering and leaving your veins. They are so still and yet all you can feel is how alive and hot they are. They almost feel like they are made of water. They don't even feel real, but they are so hot it must be true. It's so hot between your legs now you can feel it swelling up, your tissues, your muscles clenching and hardening inside you. There's a pressure there that you can feel. It's tightening down on you, squeezing you till you're throbbing. Your blood is flowing faster now, rushing through you. Feel it. It's hot and pulsing. It flows through all of you, your whole body. Feel it flow up through your toes and into your legs. Feel it flow up through your stomach, through your chest, your arms. Feel it flow up through the sides of your neck, slowing there, and finally reaching the backs of your eyelids. Rest there for a moment. Rest in that dark space behind your eyelids. </p>
