			<h2>I Am</h2>
		</main>
		<p>A body. A neutral body. Many neutral bodies. Feeling each other. Colliding against one another. And no body. But yourself. I am slippery and wet. I am curious about everything and nothing. I am one thing. I am no thing. I want to touch and nothing else. I don't care to see or taste or smell or hear. I only feel. It's unreal. It's the slowest deal. Stickier than an orange peel. <br/> <br/>I am a riddle. I am transcribed. I am unwritten. I am alive. I'll slip through your fingers and cracks in the floor. I'll sit in your lap. And I'll reach through your door. I'll pour in your face. And I'll pour through your eyes. I'll climb up your legs. I'm not a surprise. <br/><br/> I'll slide through your thighs and I'll slip down your toes. I'm getting hotter now. Who needs these clothes? You've met me before. You know where I live. I steep in your dreams. I'll always forgive. I'm not sure you're listening, so I'll come on your face. It's sticky and sweet. A sinful escape. <br/> <br/>
But it's not so sinful. It's actually very confusing because it's so bad and so good. It's so real and so ghostly. So heavy and holy. <br/> <br/>
You might want to kiss me, but I am not real. Your veins are engorged and I made the steal. I'll sit here and rhyme and clever in time, but I'd rather you find what... I'm really getting at.... <br/><br/>
If there were a story of who I was you wouldn't be able to hear it. And you couldn't see me either. Instead you'll have to imagine me. I am invisible. I'm sorry to disappoint. No visuals are frustrating but they are real. More real than you are aware, deary. 
You can't touch me and yet you can feel me. I am the antithesis of the tangible. I am quiet and subtle. There's nothing better.  <br/><br/>
I like to play. I enjoy playing very much. That's at the core of me. I don't take anything seriously, and yet... I never smile. Everything is humorous, but I never laugh. I can here everything, and yet... I make no sound. <br/><br/>I like this quiet. Once you renounce the busy life in front of you everything becomes clear. I become clear, and yet... you'll never see me. Unless you look behind your eyelids. I live there, my deary. In the nothingness. The true void you didn't think existed. It exists, I assure you. <br/><br/> 
Do you ever dream, deary? Yes, I suppose you do, because you still sleep. You need your rest. Unlike me. I never sleep. I'm always alive, always growing. Never living. Always breathing. Inside of you. Because I am me. <br/><br/>It's not complicated at all, and yet... only a few comprehend me. Only a few lucky ones. Rather a few enlightened ones. Because luck does not exist. Just like you. You do not exist. But you can live with me behind your eyelids.  <br/><br/>
I'll explain another way.  <br/><br/>
If you will be so kind as to gently place your hands on your legs. Go ahead. Just set them there nice and still. Palms resting on pants... And now as you read this feel your fingertips resting on your thighs. Imagine the energy there like electricity, flowing between your fingertips and your thighs. Focus on that sensation. Do not move from this moment. Think only of your fingers touching your thighs. They start to feel heavy. Your legs begin to feel as though they are bolted into the floor. And the whole world has evaporated around you. But your fingertips have never felt so hot.<br/><br/>  
That's me. I'm there. You can feel me. And that's all there is to it. So simple, and yet... you don't have a clue.


<br/><br/>Does it matter what you see when you close your eyes? Do you need an image to know? A label to be? It must matter or they wouldn't tell you to do it. You must need it to see. When I close my eyes all I see is hot, wet blackness... There's a fervor there that we all know... So why does it matter what we call ourselves? Why do we have to prefer one thing over the other... I prefer everything. And nothing. Because we are everything. And we are nothing... Nothing but that black space you are so familiar with. That's where I live... forever in your frontal lobe. That's where I'd like to exist and squirm about. In a hot blackness. Or maybe it's a hot white light. Either way it's reaching out at you... As it reaches out for me. I feel it pulling my heart, my stomach, my arms, my eyes, my neck, my head, in every direction it pleases. Not one single direction ever, but every single direction... always. I can't stop it, but I can shut it down. I can't imagine it away, but I can choose to see it, choose to play with it, to make something of it. And I've made this, my deary. This place where you can see it too. Where you can feel me too. I'm otherwise invisible... like your dreams are invisible... Wouldn't that be just delicious? If others could see our dreams? Wouldn't it be just the most terrible thing? ...I don't think so. I think we would get used to it... I think we would resolve to accept it... We wouldn't need labels and pictures anymore. We would all just understand that moist, hot darkness we'd all like to touch.  </p>
